# Getting up and running
## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the latest version of `nodejs` and `yarn` installed locally.

# Running the project

From the command line run the following:
- `yarn install` (this will download all dependencies)
- `npm start` (this will start the webpack development server with hot reload)
- `npm run storybook` (this will start a separate webpack server for storybook, also with hot reloading)
